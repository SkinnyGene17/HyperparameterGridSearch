HOW TO RUN PROJECT:

Note: It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment. 

Step 1: Install required packages by running 'pip install requirements.txt' in the environment terminal.

Step 2: Run "tkinterUI.py". A window will shortly appear. 

Step 3: In this window, input any optimizers, amounts of epochs, and batch sizes you want to test with the Grid Search (separated by whitespace, DO NOT USE COMMAS!) and press Add.
The Grid Search will then run in the terminal from which tkinterUI.py was run; results will take about an hour depending on how many hyperparameters you wish to test.
